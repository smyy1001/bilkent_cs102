In this homework I was how hard it is to work within a team were everyone is working on the project seperatly.
It took way longer to understand what the method is supposed to do than actually writing the code.
Having experienced this sort of a task as a homework is something very valuable and didactive. 
I have to admit that I wanted to delete some parts or rewrite some methods(especially the names of methods).
However after spending a couple of hours and mind maping the algorithm I finally found a way to make it work.
I understood how important it is to plan (as Pseudocode) before actually start typing, again.
In short; working on someone elses code is much harder than I tought and requires a lot of thinking.
